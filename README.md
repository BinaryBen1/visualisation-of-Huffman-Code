### Huffman Code

This Python code demonstrates the creation and visualization of a Huffman tree, a method used for data compression. The following libraries and dependencies are required:

#### Libraries:
- `matplotlib` for visualizing the Huffman tree

#### Dependencies:
- Python 3.12.0

#### Usage:
- The code defines a `Node` class representing the nodes in the Huffman tree.
- `generate_frequency_table(text)` creates a frequency table for characters in the input text.
- `generate_huffman_tree()` constructs the Huffman tree based on the frequency table.
- `plot_huffman_tree(node)` visualizes the constructed Huffman tree using matplotlib.

#### Example:
- The provided code visualizes the Huffman tree for the text "MISSISSIXXI". The frequency table and the corresponding Huffman tree are displayed using matplotlib.

### How to Use:
1. Input the text you want to analyze
2. Ensure you have Python 3.12.0 installed.
3. Install the required library:
    ```
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
4. Run the code to generate the frequency table and visualize the Huffman tree.

### Note:
- The code might encounter issues for texts with a limited number of distinct characters, possibly due to plotting constraints.
- The Huffman tree visualization might need adjustments for better clarity based on the input text.
